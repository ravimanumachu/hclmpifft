transpose.h, transpose.c
             --- Contains local transpose of a signal (Homogeneous and Heterogeneous) matrix

mpicomm.h, mpicomm.c
             --- Contains MPI implementations of tranpose (Homogeneous and Heterogeneous matrices)


I duplicate here some files for cluster code:  hclfftw.h, fpm_cluster.c and fpm_cluster.h.
Changes consist mainline function parameters and how processes (and threads per process) deals with the data in their matrix rows.


(To be done:)

- Heterogeneous implementation
  a) Local (threads-based)
  b) MPI code

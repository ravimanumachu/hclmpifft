transpose.h, transpose.c
             --- Contains local transpose of a signal (Homogeneous and Heterogeneous) matrix

mpicomm.h, mpicomm.c
             --- Contains MPI implementations of tranpose (Homogeneous and Heterogeneous matrices)


To be done:

- Heterogeneous implementation
  a) Local (threads-based)
  b) MPI code

Files in this directory are duplicated:

<filename> are original files (working on a node)
<filename>_cluster are files which work in the Hazel Hen cluster (HLRS). 

Cluster files include a set of changes, as not to allocate all the matrices 
in every node (but only the rows they deal with). They are implemented
as a benchmark for measuring performance in the cluster.
Changes in other files in ../common directory are needed, hence, duplicate for those files are on ../tauloplib.


Compiling and executing:
------------------------

1) Load modules and:
export FFTWHOME=$HOME/software/hclmpifft/fftw-3.3.7

2) make clean
make -f Makefile_cluster

3) ./fftw2_script.sh <N>
with N=size of the matrix (square)

Note that this code is tested in HLRS Hazel Hen and configurations, modules and others must be changed to meet other platforms. Start point: Makefile_cluster

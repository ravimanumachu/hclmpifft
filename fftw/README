Files in this directory are duplicated:

mpifftw.c is original file (working in a node)
mpifftw_cluster.c is the file which work in the Hazel Hen cluster (HLRS).

Cluster file includes a set of changes, as not to allocate all the matrices
in every node (but only the rows everyone is going to calculate). It is implemented
as a benchmark for measuring performance in the cluster.

Makefile_cluster is a Makefile to compile mpifftw_cluster.c:

$ <load modules and export FFTWHOME=$HOME/software/hclmpifft/fftw-3.3.7>
$ make clean
$ make -f Makefile_cluster

fftw2_script.sh is an example of script for launching "mpifftw" executable. Script takes as a parameter the size of the (square) matrix.
Executable mpifftw takes the following parameters:
N: size of the (square) matrix
Q: number of groups threads in a node (processes per node)
t: Number of threads in each group
LB: load balanced or not
v: verbose mode
NReps: number of repetitions of the FFTW kernel (benchmarking)

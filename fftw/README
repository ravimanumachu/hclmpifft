Files in this directory are duplicated:

<filename> are original files (wrking in a node)
<filename>_cluster are files which work in the Hazel Hen cluster (HLRS). 

Cluster files include a set of changes, as not to allocate all the matrices 
in every node (but only the rows they deal with). They are implemented
as a benchmark for measuring performance in the cluster.
